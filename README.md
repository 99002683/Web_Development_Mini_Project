# Web Development Mini-Project: QuoteSite



----------------------------------------------
<p style='text-align: justify;'> Nowadays, in our busy and hectic lives we are often plagued by a feeling of despair, and an irreplaceable sense of discontent. Especially in times like these, our morale often tends to be subdued by the repeated onslaught of sad and unpleasant news from around the world. When this happens, we tend to look for sources of inspiration and motivation to trudge through the tough days. Often reading an encouraging quote, and/or interesting & motivational excerpt/s from people who've faced tough situations does wonders to lift our spirits up, however, finding them is a chore in itself. </p>

To ease ourselves from finding these much needed quotes/excerpts, we came up with this webpage called: **QuoteSite**. 
* _It allows the user to search for those motivational quotes/excerpts easily by using the interface, according to their authors or their categories._
* _The page has been designed with ease of use in mind._
* _The UI is clutterfree and pleasant to use._
* _The styling elements used for designing the web-page are very light on the system in use, therefore, it's not that resource intensive._

-----------------------------------------------
Hope you enjoy using the tool that we've come up with.
